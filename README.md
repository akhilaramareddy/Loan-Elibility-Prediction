# Loan-Elibility-Prediction
This project aims to predict whether a customer is eligible for a loan based on their financial and credit history. Using a dataset of over 100,000 anonymized loan records, the model helps automate decision-making for loan approvals.

üìå What I Did
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed trends and patterns in loan status, income, credit score, and job history.

Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, outliers, and categorical encoding to prepare the data for modeling.

Feature Engineering: Created and refined features like credit utilization and loan-to-income ratio to improve model performance.

Model Building: Trained classification models using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

Evaluation: Achieved an accuracy above 70% using test data, meeting the project‚Äôs benchmark for reliable prediction.

Output: Final model outputs customer ID and a predicted loan status label (Approved/Not Approved).
